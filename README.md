Project Setup
Frontend

Navigate to frontend folder

Include AngularJS CDN or local files

Open index.html in a browser

Backend

Navigate to backend folder

Initialize Node.js project:

npm init -y


Install dependencies:

npm install express mysql2 body-parser cors jsonwebtoken bcryptjs


Run server:

node server.js

Database

Install MySQL

Create database: store_sales_db

Create tables: users, products, customers, sales, sale_items

Connect backend to database using mysql2 or sequelize

Data Flow

Frontend sends requests to backend APIs using AngularJS $http or fetch().

Backend validates inputs, performs business logic, and interacts with the database.

Database stores persistent data for products, customers, sales, and reports.

Backend returns JSON responses to the frontend for display.

Testing

Frontend: Jasmine + Karma for UI and validation testing

Backend: Postman, Mocha/Chai, Jest for API testing

Database: Manual CRUD tests, queries for accuracy

Integration: End-to-end test: Login → Add Product → Create Sale → Generate Report

Security: Test JWT authentication and input validation

Performance & Security Checks

Database optimization and indexing

Fast API responses

Minified JS/CSS, lazy loading images

Input validation and role-based access

HTTPS / SSL for secure communication

Regular database backups

Vulnerability scans for SQLi, XSS, CSRF

Version Control

GitHub repository recommended

Branching strategy: main (stable), dev (development), feature/* (feature branches)

Commit messages: descriptive, e.g., feat: add product API, fix: bug in sales calculation

Optional: GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Future Enhancements

Real-time notifications via WebSockets

Integration with payment gateways

Multi-store management

Advanced analytics and predictive sales trends
